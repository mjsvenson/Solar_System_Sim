Name: Matthew Svenson

This software was designed to implement a physics engine into the static solar system image made before. I accomplished exactly that, creating a physcis engine which emulates a solar system completed with a timer, music, and an alternative universe "TheStarWars.txt". To show how you too can create custom solar systems
